Hello guys! We're back!

As I did for [projects using Django](https://marcospereirajr.com.br/posts/django-getting-started/) I created scaffolding for projects in Golang.

In the scaffolding project I used some dependencies:
- [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) as the HTTP router.
- [uber-fx](https://github.com/uber-go/fx) for dependency injection.

Also, I tried using the standard project layout described [here](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

[Project repository](https://github.com/marcospereirampj/golang-scaffolding)

For the guys with suggestions for improvements, just send a [_PR_](https://github.com/marcospereirampj/golang-scaffolding/pulls) or create an [_issue_](https://github.com/marcospereirampj/golang-scaffolding/issues) in the project.

See you later guys! :)
