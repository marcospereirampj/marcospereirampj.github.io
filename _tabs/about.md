Hello everyone!

### Why create a blog?

My goal with this blog is simple: to share my experiences. Therefore, I will put a large part of my professional, academic, and personal experiences here. I will explain several areas: programming, DevOps, projects, management, tools, languages, methodologies, and other subjects.

### Who am I?

My name is Marcos Pereira. I graduated in Computer Science at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), year 2011/1.  I work professionally in the area of software development since 2007, practically when I started college.

I've worked in a few companies:
- I started my career as an intern at the Federal University of Alagoas;
- I was a programmer and software engineer at ADM Projetos e Consultorias (Maceió/Alagoas);
- I was a Software Engineer and Team Leader at Oolah Consultoria e Serviços Empresariais (Maceió/Alagoas);
- I was Software Engineer and Team Leader at NYX Knowledge (São Paulo/AL);
- I was a Software Engineer and Architect at Agriness (Florianópolis/SC);
- I was a Software Engineer and technical leader at Mercado Livre. Where I am currently a Software Expert (Technical Manager).

Well, I think that's it, folks.
